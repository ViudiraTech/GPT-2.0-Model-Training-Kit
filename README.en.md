# GPT-2.0 Model Training Kit

### 🌟 Brief introduction.

Welcome to the world of GPT-2.0 language models! 🎉 This is an implementation of a PyTorch-based GPT-2.0 model that is capable of generating coherent, meaningful, and stylistically diverse text. 📝 GPT-2.0 is a powerful natural language processing model capable of understanding and generating human language, which is widely used in chatbots, text summarization, content creation, and more.

### 🚀 Get started quickly

#### 🔧 Environmental requirements

* 🐍 Python 3.6+  
* 🔗 PyTorch 1.0+  
* 💻 CUDA (Optional, if you have a GPU, you can make the training fly!) )

#### 🛠 Installation

1. Clone the project to the local computer:  
`git clone https://github.com/ViudiraTech/GPT-2.0.git`  
  
2. Install Dependencies:  
`pip install xxx`

#### 🎮 Run

1. Data collation:  
Store the raw datasets (chat logs, conversations, etc.) that will be used for training in the data.txt.  
  
2. Data processing:  
Run process_data.py scripts to process the data and generate a vocabulary:  
`python process_data.py`  
  
3. Model Training:  
Run train.py scripts to train your GPT-2.0 model:  
`python train.py`  
  
🏋️ ♂️ In this process, your model will learn how to generate text from large amounts of text data. Training may take some time, but patience is worth it!  
  
4. Model Evaluation:  
Run demo.py scripts to evaluate and test your model:  
`python demo.py`  
  
🎪 Now you can interact with your model! Enter a question and see how witty the model answers you.  

### 📚 File structure

* process_data.py - 🔧 Data processing scripts for preparing training data and generating vocabularies.  
* gpt_model.py - 🧠 Contains the definition and related functions of the GPT model, which is the brain of the model.  
* train.py - 🏫 Model training script for training GPT-2.0 models, just like learning in school.  
* demo.py - 🎪 A model evaluation script that interacts with the model and generates text, and is a stage to showcase the model's learnings.
* data.txt - 📚 Raw dataset for training the corpus of the GPT-2.0 language model, which can be a chat log or a bunch of conversations.
